Hi there,<br>
<br>
Nice app you made with Laputa for {project_name}!<br>
<br>
Here is what's next:<br>

<ul>
    <li>Prepare your firmware to work with Dynamic Provisioning workflow. Check the <a href="http://help.laputa.cc/hardware-and-libraries/esp8266/myplant-demo">tutorial</a>.</li>

    <li>For Dynamic Provisioning you don't need to upload Auth Tokens to your devices. During the provisioning process, device will be connected to your WiFi network and will obtain a new Auth Token automatically. Learn <a href="http://help.laputa.cc/publishing-apps-made-with-laputa/1240196-provisioning-products-with-auth-tokens/dynamic-auth-token-provisioning">how Device Provisioning works</a>.</li>
</ul>

<b>If you would like to publish your app to App Store and Google Play, check out our <a href="https://www.laputa.io/plans/">plans</a> and send a request.</b><br>

Let's build a connected world together!<br>
